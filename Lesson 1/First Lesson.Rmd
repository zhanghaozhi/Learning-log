# The Data Scientist's Tool Box

#### Using data/fact to answer questions

#### Bigdata:

Increasing **Volume** + Astonishing **Velocity** + Tremendous
**Variety** + Messy and **Unstructured**

#### Skills:

substantive expertise + Hacking(programming) skills + Math/statistics
knowledge

Data need to be Collected, examined and considered to help decision
making\

Data is a set of values of qualitative and quantitative variables\
\* Color is a quantitative variable (measured on ordered, continuous
scales)\
\* The question (SMART) you are trying to answer is the most important
thing\

Error message is important for beginners (most time error is command
typos)\

Be specific when you asking for help.

#### Installation:

\* [Basic package](https://cran.r-project.org)\
\* [RStudio
download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)\
\* [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/)

#### Packages:

a collection of functions and data\
\* [RDocuments](https://www.rdocumentation.org/) with the theme in mind\
\* install.packages() and library() in console panel\
\* Update packages frequently in packages panel\
\* sessionInfo() to check the R version, operating system, and loaded
packages\
\* Detach("package:ggplot2", unload=TRUE) to uninstall or packages panel

#### Version control:

\* Git: Version control system, snapshot of the file\
\* All changes saved and shared to Repository, AKA Repo\
\* Stage the file and Commit the change of the file\
\* Push the commit to the online shared repository  \* Pull is to
download a local copy to edit  \* Merge the branch; Conflict of the
branch\
\* [GitDownload](https://git-scm.com/download) to link Git with RStudio\
\* `gitconfig --global user.name "USERNAME"`\
`git config --global user.email EMAIL`\
To associate the name/email with each commits\
`git config --list` to check the information\
`exit`\

#### Link Github and RStudio

RStudio -\> Tools -\> Global Options -\> Git/SVN -\> Browse Git
Executable directory -\> Create SSH RSA key -\> Close -\> View Public
Key -\> Copy text -\> Go to Github -\> Profile -\> Settings -\> SSH and
GPG key -\> New SSH Key -\> Paste and Confirm\

#### RStudio operation:

Git in Environment Panel -\> Stage check of the change -\> small Commit
button -\> Commit message -\> Commit in the new window -\> Push -\>
Check on your Github!\

#### Add existing project to Github for version control

Got confused so quickly, [markdown and do the rest
first](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools/lecture/wbfrX/projects-under-version-control).\

#### R Markdown

a file format for making dynamic documents with R\
\* --- YAML section (metadata) ---\
\* a code chunk is `{r descriptive text}, end with`; will display plain
text if the back tick number is wrong\
\* \### for headers, more makes it smaller\
\* `in line code`\
\* `*` for bullet points (whitespace afterwards)\
\* `[embedded links](address of your content)`\
\* Need to embed images `![embedded images](address of your content)`\
\* `ggasve(“name”)`\
\* Can not export as image file\

#### Types of Data Science questions

1.  Descriptive: describe or summarize a set of data, like censuses\
2.  Exploratory: Examine the data and find connections and relationship,
    but **Correlation does not imply Causation**\
3.  Inferential: use small samples(information) to say something about
    the population\
4.  Predictive: use current or historical data to make predictions about future\
5.  Causal: see what happens to one variable when manipulate another variable, (randomize control... etc.)\
6.  Mechanistic: Understand the exact changes in variables that lead to exact changes in other variables \


#### Experimental Design

Ask -> Prepare -> Process -> Analyze -> Share -> Act\

Formulate your question (in advanced of any data collection) -> Design your experiment (dependent variable vs. independent variable, Confounded vs. *Randomized*, blinding + control, less vs. more replicates) -> Identify problems and sources of error -> Collect th data\

p-hacking values\
[definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsU-O2Z1rAs), is important in statistic.\
[H0 null hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis): no observed difference in distribuition - all samples have same possibility
Smaller the p value, the greater the evidence against the null hypothesis (distribution shifted more toward 0 value - see the result by chance).\
p ~ 0.05, strong evidence against H0.
